# Kata: Counting Change

Write a recursive function that counts how many different ways you can make
change for an amount, given a list of coin denominations. For example, there are
3 ways to give change for 4 if you have coins with denomination 1 and 2:
1+1+1+1, 1+1+2, 2+2.

Do this exercise by implementing the countChange function in a language of your
choice. This function takes an amount to change, and a list of unique denominations for the
coins. Its signature is as follows:

(Scala)
```
def countChange(money: Int, coins: List[Int]): Int
```

(Haskell)
```
countChange :: Int -> [Int] -> Int
```

**Hint**: Think of the degenerate cases. How many ways can you give change for 0
CHF(swiss money)? How many ways can you give change for >0 CHF, if you have no
coins?
